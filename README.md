1)Install NodeJs(LTS version should be good)
2)Clone the this repository. 
3)"cd payroll" . The Payroll folder is where the Express backend will run. This sever will run the 
  routes for this project. 
4)"npm install". NPM is package manager, it has all the APIs that we will be using to build this application. 
5)"cd client". The client is where the front end application is and the front end server. 
6)"npm install" again
7) You will need to start both the front end and the backend server. 
   type "npm start" in the client folder to run front end. It will be on port localhost:3000
   "cd .." to exit out of child directory back to payroll folder.
   type "npm start" in the payroll folder to start back server, which will be on port localhost:5000
  
8)Browser should automatically make the application appear. However, if it doesnt work type "localhost:3000".
9)End both servers when comple by typing "control c" to both client and payroll folder. 

LET ME KNOW IF ANYTHING IS INCOMPLETE
